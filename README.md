# Possible Quiz Types
1. Word frequency
  - within a given play, pick which of two words occurs more often (example: "Which word appears more often in Much Ado About Nothing: 'this' or 'this other word?'")
  - Given a list of 3 words from a given play, place them in order of frequency
2. Character weight
  - Within a given play, which of two characters has more lines?
  - Given a list of 3 characters from a given play, rank them by most lines spoken
3. Quote recognition
  - Given a quote of some fixed number of lines, guess the play from which it comes
    - possibly have the ability to ask for additional lines for help (but would reduce score)
  - True or false: does a given quote come from a given play?
4. Play chronology
  - Given a list of 3 plays, place them in chronological order
  - True or False: play x was written before play y
5. Character placement
  - Name the play from whence a given character comes (could possibly ask for additional characters to be listed in order to help with guessing)
  - True or False: a given character appears in a given play
